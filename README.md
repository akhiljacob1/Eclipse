# Solar Eclipse 3D visualization
<img src="/src/assets/example.gif" width="500" height="500"/>

Around the time of the solar eclipse of April 8th 2024, I was looking for a 3d globe with the eclipse path. I could only find videos or gifs but I wanted to have more control over the globe such as moving and zooming.

So I started a project to see if I could create my own version. Looked like I needed three.js so I used this opportunity to upskill a bit on three.js.
